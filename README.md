### Docs
[Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/camera/)

#### How you use Camera App: 

* This application assumes you have expo-cli installed on your local machine and the expo app on your mobile device.  

*Local Machine:*
1. `npm install expo-camera`
2. `npm start` : this command will run Expo DevTools in your browser using http://localhost:19002/

*Mobile:*
1. Open Camera and take a picture of the QR code - this will open the Expo app, running Camera App on your phone.
2. The App will ask permission to use your camera.
3. Once granted, your camera will be in use. You are able to use both the front and back cameras by clicking the word ‘flip’.
4. To take a picture, take a screenshot.
